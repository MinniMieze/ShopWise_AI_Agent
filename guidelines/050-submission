# Submission

Submissions should be made via a simple url/website that can demonstrate the assistants/agent’s capability. That should be accompanied by a corresponding github repository that contains the source code for the project so judges can match the functionalities observed to the code.

**Submission guidelines:**

**1. Showcase Website and GitHub Repository:**
Participants should deploy their AI-powered customer support assistant on an accessible website that demonstrates the assistant's functionality. This website must be accompanied by a GitHub repository containing the complete implementation. The repository should be publicly accessible and the corresponding github repository should accompany it.

**2. Alternative Submission (if Website isn’t Infeasible):**
If deployment on a website is not possible due to technical constraints, participants must submit a thoroughly organized GitHub repository as an alternative. This repository should demonstrate the implementation with additional rigor in documentation, code comments, and a clear README that guides users through the features and functionalities of the assistant. Comprehensive instructions for testing the solution locally or on a personal server should be included, along with clear usage examples to showcase the assistant's capabilities.
In both cases, it is preferred to have:
- A clear explanation of the tech stack chosen and architecture design.
- A set of instructions for installation and running the solution.
- Documentation that explains key features, code structure, and how the solution meets the evaluation criteria.
  
However, if the website with the solution works, we will use the github repo only as a reference, while in the context of item 2, these points will be weighted as criteria.
