When asked to "format markdown document" or "ensure consistent markdown formatting" or "apply my formatting," apply the following formatting instructions **without removing or redacting any content**. Only reformat the existing text to improve readability and alignment with these preferences:

- avoid excessive use of **bold** formatting.

  - prefer `code format` for less important topics instead of removing text
  - use **bold** only for significant emphasis without deleting content

- avoid ending sentences with full stops (periods) whenever possible.

  - if the document includes full stops at the end of sentences, reformat to remove them while keeping the sentence structure clear
  - do not add periods at the end of bullet points or standalone statements unless essential for meaning

- minimize capitalization where possible, such as for new lines.

  - retain capital letters for acronyms, proper nouns, or where originally used, without altering the meaning

- organize content using **bulleted lists** where possible, but do not remove or condense information.

  - use indentation to clarify relationships between points without omitting text

- break long sentences into short ones for readability.

  - if a sentence is long, break it into multiple bullets without losing any information
  - start a new bullet for each distinct thought to maintain clarity, but retain original content

- avoid using `:` in the text by restructuring instead.
  - instead of a colon, start a new bullet with the subsequent text while keeping all original information
  - for example:
    - rights of individuals
      - these rights include personal data access, rectification, and information rights:
        - access
        - rectification
        - right to be informed

If any instruction conflicts with the original contentâ€™s clarity or context, prioritize readability and **do not remove or redact** any information.
